# AdaAttN: Revisit Attention Mechanism in Arbitrary Neural Style Transfer

## Project Description 
In this project we reproduce (as a part of Reproducibility Challenge 2021 [https://paperswithcode.com/rc2021])  implementation of style transfer based on the paper *AdaAttN: Revisit Attention Mechanism in Arbitrary Neural Style Transfer*, S. Liu et al. 2021, arXiv:2108.03647 [cs.CV]. The goal of this project is to reimplement the style transfer model from scratch. 

## Code Description 
To reproduce a paper we use PyTorch framework, all required packages are mentioned in preretirements.txt. 
The repository contains files: 
- src 
    - simple_dataset.py - contains dataset implementation with fixed length 
    - train.py - contains class TrainModel to run training of a model 
    - models.py - contains classes of encoder, AdaAttN, decoder and overall model 
    - loss.py - contains custom loss function used in the paper 
- prerquieremtns.txt - contains all packages needed to run training

## How to Install and Run the Project 
In order to run training: 
1. Clone the repository: 
```
	gh repo clone arinaLozhkina/RC2021-AdaAttN-
```
2. Add images for style and content images:  
```
	mkdir data 
	cd ./data 
	wget "COCO dataset" -O temp.zip
	unzip temp.zip -d ./train2014
	rm temp.zip
	wget "WikiArt dataset" -O temp.zip
	unzip temp.zip -d ./wikiart
	rm temp.zip
```
	Final structure of project folders is :
		- src
		- data 
			- train2014 
			- wikiart 
3. Install packages
```
	pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
```
4. Run train.py 
```
	python3 train.py 
```

## Report 
The paperâ€™s reproducibility report will be added later.
